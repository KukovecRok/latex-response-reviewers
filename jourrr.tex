Comments to the Author.

General comment of reviewer to the author.

\response{true}{blue}{Authors thanks the Reviewer 1 for his/her positive mention about our work.}

\comment{The weights (eq 19) of the objectives will be crucial to the quality of maps
produced, and I guess will be highly problem-specific. how might we go about tuning them?}

\response{false}{blue}{In order to satisfy this and also the demands of the other reviewers, the fitness
function was defined as [in pag. 6, para. 3.1.4]:}

\comment{The maximum line length, as the authors note, is also highly problem specific. There might not be a clear cutoff between important and unimportant features where this threshold can be set. Have the authors any thoughts on this? It would be worth discussing this somewhere.}

\response{false}{blue}{Authors thanks the Reviewer 1 for his/her comment. The parameter maximum line length is crucial for optimizing algorithm and therefore the new subsection was added to solve the issue [in pag. 9, para. 4.3.1.2]:}
